This is a work-in-progress

*** WIP * WIP ***

This repo is an idea for a rust-base url shortener that could be used in an environment where using your own host/domain is important. For instance, improved security around the passing of urls.

This is not intended as a high-volume/high-throughput applications, but rather being able to host your own implementation and control the environment.


## Requirements

The backend is written in rust

The frontend is an api

The database is redis

** TBD **
